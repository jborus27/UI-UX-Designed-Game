# UI-UX-Designed-Game
A class project-- I worked as the UI/UX manager in a project to create this game in code.org. The project was meant to mimic 
how teams work to create projects like these-- as the UI/UX manager, I did a lot of hands-on work for the UI. I 
worked with a team who coded the rest of the pieces, and I implemented my designs to the finished game. I even
had to add an option to view the game in German.
